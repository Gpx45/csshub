Conflicts & Cascades:
---------------------


p {color:black;}
p {color:red;}  <-- This rule will win


ID selector WILL WIN, this is because it is more specific in the selection of the tag
AND it has more points so it it is worth more in terms of points, then just the P tag selector alone.

#main-content p {color:black} <-- This rule wins
p {color:red:}


How to determine specificity in tags (Point System)
This basically determines which rules will be applied.

---------------------
IDs = 100 points    |
Classes = 10 points |
Elements = 1 point  |
---------------------

The more selectors you have the more points its worth, meaning they add up

In this example:
#main-content p {color:black} <-- This selector is worth 101 points

Compared to this example
p {color:red} <-- This is worth 1 point

All you have to do is remember to point system and apply to the rules when
editting your CSS.
