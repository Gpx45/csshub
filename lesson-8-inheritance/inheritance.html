Inheritance Tree

<body>
    <div>
        <p> Text</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Text</h1>
</body>

In this scenario we have a Body tag and within it you have a div and inside
you have a p tag

Ex. If you were to give the <div> tag and rule of color:blue;
Then every tag inside no matter how many levels, would inherit the color blue.

This works for all tags.
